       "The Xbox Series X runs like an Xbox One swallowed a Lambo"
       <br><br>
The Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S  are home video game consoles developed by Microsoft. They were both released on November 10, 2020 as the fourth generation of the Xbox console family, succeeding the Xbox One family. Along with Sony's PlayStation 5, also released in November 2020, the Xbox Series X and Series S are part of the ninth generation of video game consoles.
      
      <br><br>

    The platform was launched in two variants: a base model with an Ultra HD Blu-ray–compatible optical disc drive, and a Digital Edition lacking this drive, serving as a lower-cost model for those who prefer to buy games through digital download.

        ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ <br><br>
    <p>A The Xbox Series X resembles a gaming PC in nearly every way, from its tower-like form factor to its multi-tiered approach to bringing gamers on multiple platforms together. ... It’s everything we’ve been waiting for — and then some — out of the next Xbox. The only thing it’s missing? More exclusives.</p>

        <strong>Rich Woods</strong>⭐⭐⭐<br><br>
    <p> The Xbox Series X represents a massive improvement over its predecessors. With a blisteringly fast SSD, a powerful GPU, and an impossibly quiet cooling system, this system ushers in the 4K / 60 era with a bang. Throw in far-reaching backwards compatibility, support for variable refresh rate, auto low latency input, and Smart Delivery, and this device is easily a must-have for this Holiday Season.</p>

        <strong>Jeff Grubb</strong>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ <br><br>
    <p>Series X is a console for hardcore gamers who need the bleeding edge of gaming technology. It provides the same performance as the top-end, £2k+ gaming PCs - featuring fast load-times from the SSD, 60FPS, and better graphics - but costs less than £500, without the hassle of having to build it yourself. The console is a big, bold statement, both physically in your living room and for what it adds to your games, and the serious players looking for that true next-gen experience will find everything they are looking for in the advanced Xbox Series X.</p>
